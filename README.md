# Canonical LR Parser 

  This project generates a CLR table from the given grammar, and attempts to parse an input string using the resultant table.
  
  As of now, only the code for generating the table has been completed and tested.

### Usage:
* For the frontend program:
  ```python3 clr_with_gui.py```
  
* For the pure backend program:
  ```python3 clr_backend.py```
  to generate a CLR table, or
  ```python3 slr_backend.py``` 
  to generate an SLR table.
