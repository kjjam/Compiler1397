# Bottom up parsers

In this project we have coded shift reduce parser generators algorithm and create tables for them.
LR(0), LR(1), LALR(1) and SLR parsers are included.

### Usage:
* For the frontend program which is available for lr(1):
  ```python3 clr_with_gui.py```
  
* For the pure backend program:
  ```python3 clr_backend_only.py```
  to generate a LR(1) table, or
  ```python3 slr_backend_only.py``` 
  to generate an SLR table, or
  ```python3 lalr1_backend_only.py```
  to generate a LALR(1) table, or
  ```python3 lr0_backend_only.py```
  to generate a LR(0) table.

or do ```python3 main.py``` and follow step by step!
enjoy it!
